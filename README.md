## 📋 Overview

Metro Backend Application is a microservices backend system for the metro management application, developed by the HCMURS organization. The system is designed with a microservices architecture using Spring Boot and Spring Cloud.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The system is designed with the following microservices:

| Service | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `eureka-service` | Service discovery for microservices |
| `gateway-service` | API Gateway that manages requests from clients |
| `auth-service` | Authentication and authorization management |
| `user-service` | User information management |
| `station-service` | Station and route information management |
| `ticket-service` | Ticket and booking information management |
| `order-service` | Order and payment management |
| `notification-service` | User notification management |

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Java 21**: Main programming language
- **Spring Boot 3.4.4**: Application development framework
- **Spring Cloud 2024.0.1**: Microservices framework
- **Spring Security**: Authentication and authorization
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database
- **Redis**: In-memory database and caching
- **JWT**: Token-based authentication
- **Eureka**: Service discovery
- **OpenFeign**: Client-side load balancing and REST client
- **SpringDoc OpenAPI**: API documentation (Swagger)
- **Lombok**: Reduces boilerplate code
- **MapStruct**: Object mapping
- **Docker**: Application containerization

## 🚀 Installation and Running

### System Requirements

- Java 21 or higher
- Maven 3.8 or higher
- Docker and Docker Compose (if running containerized)
- PostgreSQL (if running locally)
- Redis (if running locally)

### Environment Configuration

Create an `.env` file in the root directory and in the `/scripts` directory (if applicable) with the necessary configurations. Refer to the required environment variables for each service.

### Running the Entire Application

#### Using Maven

```bash
mvn clean package
mvn spring-boot:run -pl services/eureka-service
mvn spring-boot:run -pl services/gateway-service
mvn spring-boot:run -pl services/auth-service
# Run other services similarly
```

#### Using Docker

```bash
# Build Docker images for each service
mvn clean package -P docker

# Or build a specific service
mvn clean package -P eureka
mvn clean package -P gateway
mvn clean package -P auth
# etc.

# Use Docker Compose to run the entire system
docker-compose up
```

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
mvn test
```
